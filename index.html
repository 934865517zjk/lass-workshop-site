    <h2>The 1st Workshop on LASS: LLM Agent for Social Simulation</h2>
    <p>
        Social simulation has long played a crucial role in exploring the mechanisms underlying human behavior and societal structures.
Traditional social simulation relies on rule-based or statistical models, which makes it difficult to capture the complexity and variability of the real world. 
With the emergence and rapid development of large language model (LLM), new frontiers have been opened toward leveraging LLMs as agent to model human behavior and interactions.
This cutting-edge direction has gained significant attention and demonstrated promising results, not only advancing research across a wide range of social science disciplines, but also enabling practical applications in role-playing scenarios.
However, this field still faces multiple challenges, such as capturing real-world social phenomena, eliminating bias or ethical considerations, and ensuring usability and reliability. 
This workshop on LLM Agent for Social Simulation aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from diverse backgrounds to foster interdisciplinary collaboration, address key challenges, explore cutting-edge technologies, and chart promising future directions in this rapidly evolving field.
